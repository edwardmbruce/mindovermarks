      <h2>1. How Does Stress Affect School Performance?</h2>
      <p>Stress makes it harder for students to focus, remember lessons, or stay motivated. According to a 2020 APA study, 45% of teens said school stress impacted their ability to do schoolwork. When left unspoken, it builds up and leads to burnout, anxiety, or even dropping out.</p>

      <h2>2. How Does School Impact Mental Health?</h2>
      <p>School can help us learn — but it can also break us down. 7 in 10 Australian students report being stressed by school, with more than half blaming high workloads. Add on social anxiety, pressure to succeed, and constant comparison — and it’s easy to see why students feel overwhelmed.</p>

    <div class="why-block">
      <h2>3. What Can We Do to Help?</h2>
      <p>Start by listening. Reduce unnecessary homework. Give students safe spaces to talk. Train teachers to recognise signs of stress. And include mental health education in the classroom. When students feel supported, they learn better.</p>
